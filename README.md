OutClass
========

Android app to schedule groups at a sceduled time, or spontaneously, and push notifications to the users instantaneously, given the classes one is taking.  This app will also use the Google Maps API to show the location of meetings.  This program will be able to work with different colleges/scedules.

We are using Java to program this app as a proof-of-concept.  If this works, we plan on expanding this to different platforms (iOS, Windows, etc...)
