OutClass
========

Android app to schedule groups spontaneously, and push notifications to the users instantaneously, given the classes one is taking.  Will be scalable to different colleges.

We are using Java to program this app as a proof-of-concept.  If this works, we plan on expanding this to different platforms (iOS, Windows, etc...)
